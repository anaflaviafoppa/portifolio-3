# React Portifolio

I made my portifolio with React. It's cleaner and more professional.

# How to use:

Run the following commands:

  ```
  git cd portifolio.
  npm install
  ```
# Instructions

After all packages are installed, you can run:

 ```
  npm start
  ```
Thus, a new window will open in your browser with the React app.
